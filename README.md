# BANKING_WEBSITE
The objective is to create a form that enables users to enter banking details and store them in a MySQL database.
Upon submission, the PHP script will validate the input data and establish a connection with the MySQL database to securely store the information.
The HTML form will be designed to capture the banking details, utilizing appropriate input field
types (text, select, file upload) to ensure accurate data entry. The PHP script will handle form
submission, validate the input for completeness and correctness, and establish a connection with
the MySQL database.

Key Requirements:
1. Design an HTML form with input fields for attributes like account holder name, account number,
account type, bank name, branch name etc as mentioned above.
2. Utilize appropriate HTML input field types and attributes for each attribute, ensuring data
integrity and usability.
3. Implement PHP code to validate the form inputs, checking for completeness and correctness
before proceeding.
4. Establish a connection to the MySQL database using PHP and appropriate database credentials.
5. Create a table in the MySQL database to store the applicant information, defining the appropriate
columns and data types.
6. Insert the validated applicant data into the MySQL database table upon successful
form submission.
